0,"Hey, Soul Sister",Train,2010,neo mellow,"Hey, hey, hey Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight Hey, hey, hey Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight The way you can cut a rug
Watching you is the only drug I need
So gangsta, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of
You see, I can be myself now finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey, hey, hey (tonight)
Hey, hey, hey (tonight) "
1,Love The Way You Lie,Eminem,2010,hip hop,"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie "

4,Just the Way You Are,Bruno Mars,2010,pop,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she doesn't see what I see
But every time she asks me, do I look okay
I say When I see your face
There is not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are, hey Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday Oh, you know, you know
You know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay,
You know I'll say When I see your face
There is not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are When I see your face

Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep

Night turns to whatever we want We're young enough to say Oh, this has gotta be the good life This has gotta be the good life

What there's to complain about
When you're happy like a fool Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in
Oh, this has gotta be the good life This has gotta be the good life

Who do you think you are? And it took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Don't come back at all And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are? "

but I'd wait a million more for you
nothing prepared me for
what the privilege of being yours would do If I had only felt the warmth within your touch
if I had only seen how you smile when you blush
or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough
I would have known what I was living for all along
what I've been living for Your love is my turning page
where only the sweetest words remain
every kiss is a cursive line
every touch is a redefining phrase I surrender who I've been for who you are
for nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
if I had only felt how it feels to be yours
well, I would have known what I've been living for all along
what I've been living for Though we're tethered to the story we must tell
when I saw you, well, I knew we'd tell it well
with a whisper, we will tame the vicious seas

106,Clarity,Zedd,2013,electronic,"High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again 'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity? If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity? Walk on through a red parade
And refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground
And makes us forget all common sense Don't speak as I try to leave
'Cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep
And I'll fall right back to you 'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity? Why are you my clarity?

But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen

You were always crazy like that
I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You were always the mysterious one
with dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
Then you stood in my doorway with nothing to say
beside some comment on the weather
Well in case you failed to notice
in case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees
These foolish games are tearing me apart Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
Youre breaking my heart
You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and youd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
Excuse me, think Ive mistaken you for somebody else

Somebody more like myself

And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me

And maybe it's all part of a plan

Hoping that you'll understand That, baby, now

If I quit calling you my lover

I'll be needing stitches Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore "

Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now And I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the programme
I want you to be mine, lady
And to hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time, lady I need you, darling

If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?

Sing!
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothing to say
And nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""we found love in a local rave"", no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then hope and pray I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know?
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh

All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
I found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling?
Before the beat kicks in again Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Sing!
I need you, darling

I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise,
And I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling.
That's because I'm jealous If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself,
""Baby girl, you can't survive like this."" Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
'Yoncé fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy you been hanging out the night tonight
I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in texas
Don't be jealous No, no, no And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me "

Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
with this boy who's hollerin' and I can hardly hear
over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?""
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
But usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message
(Like we usually do) And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?"" Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done

By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely.
Once I was eleven years old. I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely.
Once I was twenty years old. I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure.
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major.
I got my boys with me atleast those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later. Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old. Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming.
Soon we'll be 30 years old. I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one

Or will I have a lot of children who can bore me

The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,

You know, ""covergirls eat nothing""
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer"", she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Ah oh, ah ah oh,
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing

But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on You watch me bleeding till I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees

I'll be needing stitches Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses

Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ""you're out of time.""
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say... Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed 'Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ""you're out of time.""

314,Behind Your Back,Nelly Furtado,2016,latin,"I've been talking about you
Behind your back
I've been telling people that I've heard things, if they ask
If we ease up and burning up, well it's a fact
I've been talking about you
Every chance I had It's nothing bad!
It's all I have!
It's just a chance to say your name
Baby, it's nothing bad
It's just a chance when I talk about you
Behind your back I've been talking about you
Behind your back
I know that talking is cheap
But baby, do the math
You were one in a million
And my whole heart's in half
I was never conscious of what I had I've been telling all my stories to anyone that asks
I've been serving them up in a half-empty glass
Don't go thinking I've lost all my class
When I'm talk in about you It's nothing bad, it's all I have
It's just a chance to say your name
Baby, it's nothing bad
It's just a chance when I talk about you
Behind your back It's nothing bad, it's all I have!
It's just a chance to say your name again
Baby, it's just a chance
It's all I have
I wanna talk about you behind your back No, it's nothing bad
It's all I have
I'm hoping you give me dirt or chance
If you came back, I'll never chance
Stop talking about you behind your back "
315,Million Years Ago,Adele,2016,r&b,"I only wanted to have fun Learning to fly learning to run I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known That this would be inevitable To earn my stripes I'd have to pay And bare my soul I know I'm not the only one Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor I feel like my life is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air I miss my friends I miss my mother I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognise me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air I miss my friends
I miss my mother I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago "

And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put ""Van the Man"" on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like Girl, you know I want your love

I may be crazy, don't mind me Say: ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""

We're going out on our first date
But you and me are thrifty
So go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag, and I fill up a plate We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play

331,There for You,Martin Garrix,2017,house,"I woke up pissed off today
And lately everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too But you gotta be there for me too Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too But you gotta be there for me too Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you?
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you Running, running just to keep my hands on you

I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who in front of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?

Don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say ""Goals""

I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face
I'm like ""Okay""
I'll let him did what he want
He buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip
When I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap

I put my hand above my hip
I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go
This shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold
Tell that lil bitch play her role
I just a-rove in a Rolls
I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank
No, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know
That none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak
Only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's
Now it's a crib with a gate
Roly got charms, look like frosted flakes
I had to let these bitches know
Just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail
Another check from Mona Scott Said little bitch, you can't fuck with me

I've been looking for lovin', all the wrong places

Too many shoes in your closet, go some miles
I suck at talking to girls, here goes a try
More woman than I should've in a century
Bitches on my side like a Kennedy
Starting to drain all my energy
I love it, shoot the frame like an enemy
At the same time, and I can't lie
Too many girls for the way that I rock the bassline
You got addicted to the seas of the bassline
Lets see how you're gonna do with the back and forth fameline
After all the shit we been through
I play the rocksea, I ain't 'bout to guestlist you
And I know I'm talking shit, it ain't fair

The ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler
I put rocks all in my watch

When they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong
I do what they say I can't

Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali
Fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu, jump in the coupe
They trippin' on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry, though
'Bout my coins like Mario

Water or wine Don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night Drunk on a feeling
Alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah all for you
I've been running through the jungle I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you To get to you, oh to get to you
(Oh to get to you)
(Oh to get to you)
Your fingertips trace my skin To places I have never been
Blindly I am following Break down these walls
And come on in

I've been running with the wolves

Watching us both turn cold

And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Oxford
Got a new apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days
All our troubles
We'll lay to rest
And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

So far from the stars And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you
It's so hard
So hard And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now Because if the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you And I know that it's wrong
That I can't move on
But there's something about you If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you "
